# Fish Tank
This application is a simple simulation game where players will manage an aquarium where they can raise, breed, and sell their fish. 

## Elevator Pitch
Are you ready to turn your aquarium hobby into a booming business? Buy fish for your tank, take good care of them, and breed them to get lots of fish babies! Keep your new fish friends, or sell them for a profit to buy more fish or aquarium decorations! Experiment with different combinations of parent fish to discover new varieties of fish! Got an aquarium you're especially proud of? Post a snapshop of it so that everyone can admire it! Will you be the greatest aquarist in town?
